An extensive set of symbols for the Air Force and Navy is found in Military Standard 2525A. The manual is a dictionary of operational terms and military graphics. It is designed for commanders and staffs from company through corps to communicate instructions to subordinate units.\\nThis manual describes symbols for use in the force domain (maneuver command and control) but does not supersede the military standards that describe symbols for use in the engagement domain (\"radar\" tracking , evaluation, engagement, or engagement system directing).  Military standards established for air defens e engagement and systems control and aircraft \"heads up\" displ ays are to be used.  When information is transferred from an engagement domain system to a force domain command and control system, it will be automatically or manually converted to the force domain symbols in this publication.\\nSCOPE AND APPLICABILITY\\nThis doctrine applies to all Army and Marine Corps commanders and staffs. For overseas theaters, th e procedures govern US unilateral operations only.  For combined operations, applicable multinational procedures apply.  This manual does conform to the appropriate NATO requirements.\\nIMPLEMENTATION PLAN\\nDefinitions and terms used in this manual agree with those expressed in Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, Army Regulation (AR) 310-25, and Fleet Marine Force Reference Publication (FM FRP) 0-14.  This manual agrees with MILSTD 2525A, subject to its approval by all services.  The provisions of this manual are the subject o f international agreement(s): 1059 National Distinguishing Letters for Use by NATO Armed Forces 2019 Military Symbols for Land Based Systems\\n2022 Intelligence Reports\\n2961 Classes of Supply of NATO Land Forces 3680 NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions (AAP-6)\\n4420 Display Symbology and Colors for NATO Maritime Units\\n'},\n",

The NBC reconnaissance uses special equipment to determine the absence or presence and extent of nuclear, chemical, or biological contamination. 3.  Engineer reconnaissance may operate with other reconnaissance forces.  Engineer reconnaissance focuses on the requirements to clear obstacles or improve routes, fords, bridges, and so forth, to assist in the uninterrupted movement of the main body force.  In military operations other than war (MOOTW), the information is used to task assets to improve the state of services, such as to prepare for rubble removal, erect temporary shelter, and provide improved sanitation.

It applies to both automated and hand-drawn graphic displays or overlays.   The control measures portrayed are for use on situation maps, overlays, and annotated aerial photographs.  They are also the standard for all simulations, to include those used in live, virtual, and constructive environments.\\nGRAPHIC OVERLAYS\\nOverlays are graphics drawn on top of a map, sketch, or photograph.  To ensure accurate alignment, the overlay must have at least two reference marks at opposite locations.  On automated displays, overlays are graphica l information that is joined electronic ally so that it can be “turned on or off” over or in front of the primary digital display, such as a map, sketch, or photograph.\\nAll obstacles, friendly, enemy, neutral, or factional, will be drawn using the color green.  These graphics are shown in the mobility and survivability section.  All friendly graphic control measures will be shown in black when drawn manually o r on a color display. Enemy graphic control measures will be shown in red.  If red is not available, they will be drawn in black with a double line or the abbreviation “ENY” placed on the graphic in at least two places to avoid confusion.  If other colors are used to show friendly or enemy  (hostile) factions, then the colors used will be shown in a legend on the overlay describing what each color means.\\nUSE OF GRAPHICS\\nThis section describes how to label various graphic control measures.  Some boundary labeling can b e abbreviated when the abbreviation will not cause confusion.  All text labeling should be drawn so that it can be read when the bottom of the overlay is closest to the reader.  Labeling  written on an angle should be readable when the overlay is turned a quarter of a turn (90 degrees) clockwise (to the left).\\n\\n'},\n",

These symbols are for use on situation maps, overlays, and annotated aerial photographs.  This chapter applies to both automated and hand-drawn graphic displays or overlays.\\nThis chapter includes a wide variety of unit symbols as well as mo difiers for building new or unique symbols.\\nUsers should avoid using any sym bols, or combinations and modifications of symbols, that differ from those  in this manual.  If the user, after searching doctrinal symbols and modifers, must create a new symbol, it must be explained in an accompanying legend.\\nThe symbols shown in t his chapter are adequate for depicting enemy units.  When representing unorthodox units and equipment, select the most appropriate symbol contained herein.\\nICON-BASED SYMBOLS\\nA symbol is composed of three components: a frame (geometric border), fill, and icon.  Frames are  geometric shapes used to display affiliation.  Affiliation refers to whether the warfighting object being represented is a threat.  The basic affiliation categories are friendly, unknown, neutral, and enemy.   The unknown frame shape is normally used only for aircraft and ships.  The frame shape for suspected friendly, enemy, or neutral is used for ground units not positively  identified.  The basic  frame shapes for units, installations, activities, and logistics sites are shown in Figure 4-1, page 4-2.\\n'},\n",

Generally, black is used for the frame, icon, and modifiers when symbols are  displayed on a light background.  White is used for these elements when they are displayed on a dark background.  A color fill can be used if an icon is displayed within the area of the frame.  Figure 4-2, from MILSTD 2525A,  shows the color defaults for affiliation used for hand-drawn and computer-generated symbols.  The use of any other colors must be explained in an accompanying legend.

An example is the crossed rifles which represent an infantry unit.\\nThis manual does not include an example of every type of unit; however, users can see from those presented the pattern of construction in order to make symbols for new or unique units.  Upon US Army and Marine Corps approval, MILSTD 2525A, Common Warfighting Symbology,  will contain more approved ground unit symbols.\\nAppendix A includes additional examples of friendly units.

They are: 1. Existing standard symbols must be used whenever possible as building blocks for new symbols.\\n2. Symbols must be usable in manual as well as automated modes.\\n3. Symbols must be easily distinguishable.\\n4. Friendly symbols must not use attributes that could be confused with enemy symbols.\\n5. Symbols must be distinguishable without color. (Monochrome display.)\\n6. Composite symbols will generally have the primary symbol centered on or below the modifying symbols.\\n7. All unit symbols will be drawn or portrayed with the top of the symbol facing the top of the overlay (normally North is at the top). Orientation of the symbol will be accomplished by using the “Q” field for moving symbols or another graphic such as a battle position or support by fire position.\\nNormally, additional information needs to be included with the unit symbol and is  placed in standardized unit labeling fields shown in Figure 4-3. The fields are defined in Figure 4-4. The unit location is determined by the center of mass of the symbol or a line (without an arrow head) from the center of the bottom of the frame to the location .\\nHeadquarters unit locations are at the bottom of the \"headquarters staff,\" displayed as field \"S.\"\\nFigure 4-3.

The combination of unit and weapo n symbols with objectives, boundaries, routes of march, and other control measures creates an indispensable tool for quickly and accurately portraying battle activity.  Standardization of techniques is essential if tactica l information is to be relayed without misunderstanding.\\nPresent and Proposed Locations Basic unit and installation symbols are drawn with either solid or broken lines.  The center of mass of the symbol indicates the general vicinity of the center of mass of the unit.  If a staff is added to identify a headquarters, the base of the staff indicates the precise location of the headquarters.\\nA solid line symbol represents a present or actual location.\\nA broken line symbol indicates a future or projected location.\\n'},\n",

       "   'text': 'C-1\\nAppendix C\\nMilitary Decisionmaking Process and Tactical Mission Graphics The basic tenets of Army doctrine are initiative, depth, agility, synchronization, and versatility.  I f commanders and staffs are to adhere to these tenets, they need information in a format that assists them to adapt quickly to the changing factors of METT-T.  The graphics portrayed in Chapters 3 through  5 are used to plot locations and directions of movement; how ever, the decision maker normally requires additional information not readily available by studying a current situ ation map.  The battlefield envisioned by our current doctrine requires rapid and frequent changes in task organization of units to retain or take the initiative and move optimall y task-organized forces to the critical point on the battlefield.  Military decisionmaking process graphics are a tool for portraying the necessary information.\\nSTATUS AND ASSESSMENT CHARTS\\nCommanders require two general categories of information when analyzing the situation map: the status of equipment and personnel, and the composition of the task-organized  forces.  Two common methods fo r displaying information and identifying status are the bar chart and the gumball chart.\\nBar Chart\\nThe bar chart is used to display quantities or percentages.  Its major advantage is that it provides a simple method for comparing status indicators to each other and to a set, standard reference  point.  Bar charts also give the staff flexibility to display and relate various types and combinations of information for the commander .\\nFigure C-1, page C-2, shows examples of various styles and information.\\nGumball Chart\\nThe gumball chart provides a clear picture of  the status of designate d elements using a color code established in the unit standing operating  procedures.  The chart assists the commander to quickly assess the status of critical elements and assists the staff to focus on problem areas.  The color code chosen should be consistent throughout all echelons of the command.  The following is a commonly used color code: GREEN indicates that the unit is at 85 percent or greater strength (combat capable); AMBER indicates that the unit is at 70 to 84 percent strength (combat capable with minor deficiencies); RED indicates that the unit is at 50 to 69 percent strength (combat ineffective, unit has major losses or deficiencies); and BLACK indicates that the unit is at less than 50 percent strength (requires reconstitution before next mission).  See the example in Figure C-2, page C-3.\\n'},\n",

Appropriate staff elements use vari ous formats to report factors such as the status of fuel, ammunition,  vehicle availability, and personnel.  The task force commander, however, provides the ne t assessment of his unit's ability to perform the mission.  This as sessment can be expressed using decision graphics as shown in Figure C-3, page C-4.\\nThe center column of Figure C-3 visually depicts the overall combat rating of the unit, and the right column specifies the status of selected items of interest.  The standing operating procedures (SOP) will specify the items of interest to be reported higher.  The subordinate commander may add to this list for his internal reporting and tracking.  The four items shown in the right column are ammunition, weapons, POL, and personnel.\\n\"},\n",

Task Force Unit Symbol\\nTASK-ORGANIZED COMPOSITION GRAPHICS\\nThe assets available to a commander are established in the operation order and may be late r modified by fragmentary and warning orders.  The composition of task-organized forces may b e portrayed by using the standard symbol syste m.  These symbols do not provide decision makers with a graphic portrayal of information relating to task-organized composition.  Figure C-4 on this page and C-5 on the next page show a task force organized around the headquarters of the 1st Battalion, 72d Infantry Regiment (Mechanized), of the 1st Brigade, 52d Infantry Division (Mechanized).  The task force unit symbol (Figure C-4) does not tell the decision maker how t he unit is organized or what the overall combat effectiveness may be.\\nAlthough this data may be available through other charts, reports, and briefings, its impact can be lost when it is in various locations.  Figure C-5 shows TF 1-72 as a task-organized composition graphic.  Figure C-6 on page C-6 shows examples of “shorthand” unit symbols for use as  decision graphics.\\n'},\n",

Example Company Team Decision Graphic\\nDECISION GRAPHICS\\n\\nCombat effectiveness graphics and task-organized composition graphics can be combined to form decision graphics.  Examples of composite decision graphics at the c ompany/team, battalion/task force, and brigade levels are at Figures C-7, 8, and  9.  Green, amber, red, or black can be used for the fill colors or outlines of the unit decision graphics to show the status of the subordinate units.\\nSubordinate units are assumed to be one echelon lower than the parent organization.  If any subordinate unit is not one echelon lower, a size indicator should be used for clarity.  For example, Task Force 1-6 Armor shows the platoon size indicator over the air defense artillery platoon shorthand  symbol (Figure C-8) because th e platoon is two echelons lower than the parent organization (TF 1-6 Armor).

An extensive set of symbols for the Air Force and Navy is found in Military Standard 2525A. The manual is a dictionary of operational terms and military graphics. It is designed for commanders and staffs from company through corps to communicate instructions to subordinate units.\\\\nThis manual describes symbols for use in the force domain (maneuver command and control) but does not supersede the military standards that describe symbols for use in the engagement domain (\\\\\"radar\\\\\" tracking , evaluation, engagement, or engagement system directing).  Military standards established for air defens e engagement and systems control and aircraft \\\\\"heads up\\\\\" displ ays are to be used.  When information is transferred from an engagement domain system to a force domain command and control system, it will be automatically or manually converted to the force domain symbols in this publication.\\\\nSCOPE AND APPLICABILITY\\\\nThis doctrine applies to all Army and Marine Corps commanders and staffs. For overseas theaters, th e procedures govern US unilateral operations only.  For combined operations, applicable multinational procedures apply.  This manual does conform to the appropriate NATO requirements.\\\\nIMPLEMENTATION PLAN\\\\nDefinitions and terms used in this manual agree with those expressed in Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, Army Regulation (AR) 310-25, and Fleet Marine Force Reference Publication (FM FRP) 0-14.  This manual agrees with MILSTD 2525A, subject to its approval by all services.

Commanders at all levels should designate a point of main effort along with supporting efforts.  This helps them and their staffs to allocate resources accordingly, providing focus to the operation while setting priorities and determining risks, promoting unity of effort, and facilitating and understanding of the commander\\'s intent.  There is only one main effort at any time in the operation, although the main effort may change as the situation changes to take advantage of opportunities or to avert failure.

It applies to both automated and hand-drawn graphic displays or overlays.   The control measures portrayed are for use on situation maps, overlays, and annotated aerial photographs.  They are also the standard for all simulations, to include those used in live, virtual, and constructive environments.\\\\nGRAPHIC OVERLAYS\\\\nOverlays are graphics drawn on top of a map, sketch, or photograph.  To ensure accurate alignment, the overlay must have at least two reference marks at opposite locations.  On automated displays, overlays are graphica l information that is joined electronic ally so that it can be \\\\u201cturned on or off\\\\u201d over or in front of the primary digital display, such as a map, sketch, or photograph.\\\\nAll obstacles, friendly, enemy, neutral, or factional, will be drawn using the color green.  These graphics are shown in the mobility and survivability section.  All friendly graphic control measures will be shown in black when drawn manually o r on a color display. Enemy graphic control measures will be shown in red.  If red is not available, they will be drawn in black with a double line or the abbreviation \\\\u201cENY\\\\u201d placed on the graphic in at least two places to avoid confusion.  If other colors are used to show friendly or enemy  (hostile) factions, then the colors used will be shown in a legend on the overlay describing what each color means.\\\\nUSE OF GRAPHICS\\\\nThis section describes how to label various graphic control measures.  Some boundary labeling can b e abbreviated when the abbreviation will not cause confusion.  All text labeling should be drawn so that it can be read when the bottom of the overlay is closest to the reader.  Labeling  written on an angle should be readable when the overlay is turned a quarter of a turn (90 degrees) clockwise (to the left).\\\\n\\\\n\"}, {\"page_number\": 193, \"text\": \"OPERATIONAL TERMS AND GRAPHICS\\\\n3-2\\\\nFor boundaries, size markings should be perpendicular to the boundary line.

These symbols are for use on situation maps, overlays, and annotated aerial photographs.  This chapter applies to both automated and hand-drawn graphic displays or overlays.\\\\nThis chapter includes a wide variety of unit symbols as well as mo difiers for building new or unique symbols.\\\\nUsers should avoid using any sym bols, or combinations and modifications of symbols, that differ from those  in this manual.  If the user, after searching doctrinal symbols and modifers, must create a new symbol, it must be explained in an accompanying legend.\\\\nThe symbols shown in t his chapter are adequate for depicting enemy units.  When representing unorthodox units and equipment, select the most appropriate symbol contained herein.\\\\nICON-BASED SYMBOLS\\\\nA symbol is composed of three components: a frame (geometric border), fill, and icon.  Frames are  geometric shapes used to display affiliation.  Affiliation refers to whether the warfighting object being represented is a threat.  The basic affiliation categories are friendly, unknown, neutral, and enemy.   The unknown frame shape is normally used only for aircraft and ships.  The frame shape for suspected friendly, enemy, or neutral is used for ground units not positively  identified.  The basic  frame shapes for units, installations, activities, and logistics sites are shown in Figure 4-1, page 4-2.\\\\n\"}, {\"page_number\": 235, \"text\": \"OPERATIONAL TERMS AND GRAPHICS\\\\n4-2\\\\nFriendly\\\\nGround Units\\\\nFriendly\\\\nSea/Air\\\\nNeutral\\\\nEnemy Units\\\\nUnknown\\\\nSea/Air\\\\nSubsurface\\\\nIn-flight\\\\nSurface\\\\nFigure 4-1.  Unit, Installation, and Site Symbol Frames Fill refers to the area within the frame. If color is used in a symbol, it shall indicate affiliation.  Generally, black is used for the frame, icon, and modifiers when symbols are  displayed on a light background.  White is used for these elements when they are displayed on a dark background.  A color fill can be used if an icon is displayed within the area of the frame.  Figure 4-2, from MILSTD 2525A,  shows the color defaults for affiliation used for hand-drawn and computer-generated symbols.  The use of any other colors must be explained in an accompanying legend.

An example is the crossed rifles which represent an infantry unit.\\\\nThis manual does not include an example of every type of unit; however, users can see from those presented the pattern of construction in order to make symbols for new or unique units.

They are: 1. Existing standard symbols must be used whenever possible as building blocks for new symbols.\\\\n2. Symbols must be usable in manual as well as automated modes.\\\\n3. Symbols must be easily distinguishable.\\\\n4. Friendly symbols must not use attributes that could be confused with enemy symbols.\\\\n5. Symbols must be distinguishable without color. (Monochrome display.)\\\\n6. Composite symbols will generally have the primary symbol centered on or below the modifying symbols.\\\\n7. All unit symbols will be drawn or portrayed with the top of the symbol facing the top of the overlay (normally North is at the top). Orientation of the symbol will be accomplished by using the \\\\u201cQ\\\\u201d field for moving symbols or another graphic such as a battle position or support by fire position.\\\\nNormally, additional information needs to be included with the unit symbol and is  placed in standardized unit labeling fields shown in Figure 4-3. The fields are defined in Figure 4-4. The unit location is determined by the center of mass of the symbol or a line (without an arrow head) from the center of the bottom of the frame to the location .\\\\nHeadquarters unit locations are at the bottom of the \\\\\"headquarters staff,\\\\\" displayed as field \\\\\"S.\\\\\"\\\\nFigure 4-3.

I f commanders and staffs are to adhere to these tenets, they need information in a format that assists them to adapt quickly to the changing factors of METT-T.  The graphics portrayed in Chapters 3 through  5 are used to plot locations and directions of movement; how ever, the decision maker normally requires additional information not readily available by studying a current situ ation map.  The battlefield envisioned by our current doctrine requires rapid and frequent changes in task organization of units to retain or take the initiative and move optimall y task-organized forces to the critical point on the battlefield.  Military decisionmaking process graphics are a tool for portraying the necessary information.\\\\nSTATUS AND ASSESSMENT CHARTS\\\\nCommanders require two general categories of information when analyzing the situation map: the status of equipment and personnel, and the composition of the task-organized  forces.  Two common methods fo r displaying information and identifying status are the bar chart and the gumball chart.\\\\nBar Chart\\\\nThe bar chart is used to display quantities or percentages.  Its major advantage is that it provides a simple method for comparing status indicators to each other and to a set, standard reference  point.  Bar charts also give the staff flexibility to display and relate various types and combinations of information for the commander .\\\\nFigure C-1, page C-2, shows examples of various styles and information.\\\\nGumball Chart\\\\nThe gumball chart provides a clear picture of  the status of designate d elements using a color code established in the unit standing operating  procedures.  The chart assists the commander to quickly assess the status of critical elements and assists the staff to focus on problem areas.  The color code chosen should be consistent throughout all echelons of the command.  The following is a commonly used color code: GREEN indicates that the unit is at 85 percent or greater strength (combat capable); AMBER indicates that the unit is at 70 to 84 percent strength (combat capable with minor deficiencies); RED indicates that the unit is at 50 to 69 percent strength (combat ineffective, unit has major losses or deficiencies); and BLACK indicates that the unit is at less than 50 percent strength (requires reconstitution before next mission).

Appropriate staff elements use vari ous formats to report factors such as the status of fuel, ammunition,  vehicle availability, and personnel.  The task force commander, however, provides the ne t assessment of his unit\\'s ability to perform the mission.  This as sessment can be expressed using decision graphics as shown in Figure C-3, page C-4.\\\\nThe center column of Figure C-3 visually depicts the overall combat rating of the unit, and the right column specifies the status of selected items of interest.  The standing operating procedures (SOP) will specify the items of interest to be reported higher.  The subordinate commander may add to this list for his internal reporting and tracking.  The four items shown in the right column are ammunition, weapons, POL, and personnel.\\\\n\"}, {\"page_number\": 289, \"text\": \"FM 101-5-1\\\\nMCRP 5-2A\\\\nC-3\\\\nOverall\\\\nTanks\\\\nBFVs\\\\nPers\\\\n1st Brigade 2d Brigade 3d Brigade\\\\nNow\\\\n24 hours 48 hours 1st Brigade\\\\nTanks\\\\nBFVs\\\\nPersonnel\\\\n2d Brigade\\\\nTanks\\\\nBFVs\\\\nPersonnel\\\\n3d Brigade\\\\nTanks\\\\nBFVs\\\\nPersonnel\\\\nFigure C-2.

These symbols do not provide decision makers with a graphic portrayal of information relating to task-organized composition.

The task force unit symbol (Figure C-4) does not tell the decision maker how t he unit is organized or what the overall combat effectiveness may be.\\\\nAlthough this data may be available through other charts, reports, and briefings, its impact can be lost when it is in various locations.

If any subordinate unit is not one echelon lower, a size indicator should be used for clarity.  For example, Task Force 1-6 Armor shows the platoon size indicator over the air defense artillery platoon shorthand  symbol (Figure C-8) because th e platoon is two echelons lower than the parent organization (TF 1-6 Armor).
