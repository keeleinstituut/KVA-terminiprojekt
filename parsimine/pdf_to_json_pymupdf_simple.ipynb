An extensive set of symbols for the Air Force and Navy is found in\\nMilitary Standard 2525A. The manual is a dictionary of operational terms and military graphics. It is designed\\nfor commanders and staffs from company through corps to communicate instructions to subordinate units.\\nThis manual describes symbols for use in the force domain (maneuver command and control) but does not\\nsupersede the military standards that describe symbols for use in the engagement domain (\"radar\" tracking ,\\nevaluation, engagement, or engagement system directing).  Military standards established for air defens e\\nengagement and systems control and aircraft \"heads up\" displ ays are to be used.  When information is transferred\\nfrom an engagement domain system to a force domain command and control system, it will be automatically or\\nmanually converted to the force domain symbols in this publication.\\nSCOPE AND APPLICABILITY\\nThis doctrine applies to all Army and Marine Corps commanders and staffs. For overseas theaters, th e\\nprocedures govern US unilateral operations only.  For combined operations, applicable multinational procedures\\napply.  This manual does conform to the appropriate NATO requirements.\\nIMPLEMENTATION PLAN\\nDefinitions and terms used in this manual agree with those expressed in Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, Army\\nRegulation (AR) 310-25, and Fleet Marine Force Reference Publication (FM FRP) 0-14.

It applies to both\\nautomated and hand-drawn graphic displays or overlays.   The control measures portrayed are for use on situation\\nmaps, overlays, and annotated aerial photographs.  They are also the standard for all simulations, to include those\\nused in live, virtual, and constructive environments.  \\nGRAPHIC OVERLAYS\\nOverlays are graphics drawn on top of a map, sketch, or photograph.  To ensure accurate alignment, the overlay\\nmust have at least two reference marks at opposite locations.  On automated displays, overlays are graphica l\\ninformation that is joined electronic ally so that it can be âturned on or offâ over or in front of the primary digital\\ndisplay, such as a map, sketch, or photograph. \\nAll obstacles, friendly, enemy, neutral, or factional, will be drawn using the color green.  These graphics are\\nshown in the mobility and survivability section.  All friendly graphic control measures will be shown \\nin black\\nwhen drawn manually o r on a color display. Enemy graphic control measures will be shown in red.  If red is not\\navailable, they will be drawn in black with a double line or the abbreviation âENYâ placed on the graphic in at\\nleast two places to avoid confusion.  If other colors are used to show friendly or enemy  (hostile) factions, then\\nthe colors used will be shown in a legend on the overlay describing what each color means.\\nUSE OF GRAPHICS\\nThis section describes how to label various graphic control measures.  Some boundary labeling can b e\\nabbreviated when the abbreviation will not cause confusion.  All text labeling should be drawn so that it can be\\nread when the bottom of the overlay is closest to the reader.  Labeling  written on an angle should be readable\\nwhen the overlay is turned a quarter of a turn (90 degrees) clockwise (to the left).\\n   \\n'},\n",

These symbols are\\nfor use on situation maps, overlays, and annotated aerial photographs.  This chapter applies to both automated\\nand hand-drawn graphic displays or overlays.\\nThis chapter includes a wide variety of unit symbols as well as mo difiers for building new or unique symbols.\\nUsers should avoid using any sym bols, or combinations and modifications of symbols, that differ from those  in\\nthis manual.  If the user, after searching doctrinal symbols and modifers, must create a new symbol, it must be\\nexplained in an accompanying legend.\\nThe symbols shown in t his chapter are adequate for depicting enemy units.  When representing unorthodox\\nunits and equipment, select the most appropriate symbol contained herein.\\nICON-BASED SYMBOLS\\nA symbol is composed of three components: a frame (geometric border), fill, and icon.  Frames are  geometric\\nshapes used to display affiliation.  Affiliation refers to whether the warfighting object being represented is a\\nthreat.  The basic affiliation categories are friendly, unknown, neutral, and enemy.   The unknown frame shape\\nis normally used only for aircraft and ships.  The frame shape for suspected friendly, enemy, or neutral is used\\nfor ground units not positively  identified.  The basic  frame shapes for units, installations, activities, and logistics\\nsites are shown in Figure 4-1, page 4-2.\\n'},\n",

A color fill can be used if an icon is displayed\\nwithin the area of the frame.  Figure 4-2, from MILSTD 2525A,  shows the color defaults for affiliation used for\\nhand-drawn and computer-generated symbols.

They are:\\n1. Existing standard symbols must be used whenever possible as building blocks for new symbols.\\n2. Symbols must be usable in manual as well as automated modes.\\n3. Symbols must be easily distinguishable.\\n4. Friendly symbols must not use attributes that could be confused with enemy symbols.\\n5. Symbols must be distinguishable without color. (Monochrome display.)\\n6. Composite symbols will generally have the primary symbol centered on or below the modifying symbols. \\n7. All unit symbols will be drawn or portrayed with the top of the symbol facing the top of the overlay (normally North\\nis at the top). Orientation of the symbol will be accomplished by using the âQâ field for moving symbols or another\\ngraphic such as a battle position or support by fire position.\\nNormally, additional information needs to be included with the unit symbol and is  placed in standardized unit\\nlabeling fields shown in Figure 4-3. The fields are defined in Figure 4-4. The unit location is determined by the center\\nof mass of the symbol or a line (without an arrow head) from the center of the bottom of the frame to the location .\\nHeadquarters unit locations are at the bottom of the \"headquarters staff,\" displayed as field \"S.\"\\n         Figure 4-3.

I f\\ncommanders and staffs are to adhere to these tenets, they need information in a format that assists them to adapt\\nquickly to the changing factors of METT-T.  The graphics portrayed in Chapters 3 through  5 are used to plot\\nlocations and directions of movement; how ever, the decision maker normally requires additional information not\\nreadily available by studying a current situ ation map.  The battlefield envisioned by our current doctrine requires\\nrapid and frequent changes in task organization of units to retain or take the initiative and move optimall y\\ntask-organized forces to the critical point on the battlefield.  Military decisionmaking process graphics are a tool\\nfor portraying the necessary information.\\nSTATUS AND ASSESSMENT CHARTS\\nCommanders require two general categories of information when analyzing the situation map: the status of\\nequipment and personnel, and the composition of the task-organized  forces.  Two common methods fo r\\ndisplaying information and identifying status are the bar chart and the gumball chart.\\nBar Chart\\nThe bar chart is used to display quantities or percentages.  Its major advantage is that it provides a simple\\nmethod for comparing status indicators to each other and to a set, standard reference  point.  Bar charts also give\\nthe staff flexibility to display and relate various types and combinations of information for the commander .\\nFigure C-1, page C-2, shows examples of various styles and information. \\nGumball Chart \\nThe gumball chart provides a clear picture of  the status of designate d elements using a color code established\\nin the unit standing operating  procedures.  The chart assists the commander to quickly assess the status of critical\\nelements and assists the staff to focus on problem areas.  The color code chosen should be consistent throughout\\nall echelons of the command.  The following is a commonly used color code: GREEN indicates that the unit is\\nat 85 percent or greater strength (combat capable); AMBER indicates that the unit is at 70 to 84 percent strength\\n(combat capable with minor deficiencies); RED indicates that the unit is at 50 to 69 percent strength (combat\\nineffective, unit has major losses or deficiencies); and BLACK indicates that the unit is at less than 50 percent\\nstrength (requires reconstitution before next mission).

This as sessment can be expressed using decision graphics\\nas shown in Figure C-3, page C-4.\\nThe center column of Figure C-3 visually depicts the overall combat rating of the unit, and the right column\\nspecifies the status of selected items of interest.
